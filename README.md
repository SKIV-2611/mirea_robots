# Robots

This is a repository that contains my (SKIV-2611) solutions of my uni tasks in Julia using HorizonSideRobots.jl package.

In order to run any of the .jl files from here you need to install Julia on your computer and add PyPlot.jl and HorizonSideRobots.jl (from GitHub) to your packages.

Further on I'm going to add descriptions to all of the solutions.
